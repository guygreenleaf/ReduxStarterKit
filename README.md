# Basic React Redux Setup

## What This Is
This is a very basic Redux setup that I use when I want to implement Redux into a React application. Has a basic store and a userSlice that exports a userReducer for login/logout.

## Use:
Place the redux folder in your project and install the following dependencies:

```bash
# If you use npm:
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux

# Or if you use Yarn:
yarn add redux @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
```
